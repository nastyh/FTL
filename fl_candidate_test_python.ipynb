    "**Date Completed:** *Date completed*\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on making it to this stage of the interview process!  For the next step of your candidacy, you will be asked to solve five unique problems; each one focuses on a distinct data science skill such as data access, data transformation, hypothesis testing, model evaluation, and lastly, you will be asked to interpret a report and make a recommendation.  You are free to use whatever languages and tools you choose for this assignment, but all code and derived data must be included in your final submission. Document formats such as `.ipynb`, `.rmd`, `.html`, and `.docx` are acceptable for submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to try and run your code, so if it references obscure libraries, please indicate this as well as how to locate/install them.  You need to be sure you do what the core task indicates; but, you should feel free to use novel and ingenious approaches. We do not want you to spend money for any API usage or external service; the project is expected to be completed within the free tier of any service. Based on the feedback from other candidates we also expect that the challenge should *not take more than two hours* to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "An evaluation rubric is not provided, but some of the things we will look at are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Completeness** and **correctness** of the project and codebase.\n",
    "2. **Robustness** and **clarity** of the documentation included with the submission \n",
    "3. **Language selection** and **library dependency** appropriateness.\n",
    "4. **Sophistication** and **ingenuity** in thinking and approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each question also contains a bonus question at the end; this part is entirely optional, and a few sentence summary is sufficient.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint:* Clarity means articulating the approach and results cleanly and concisely.  *Overly verbose code and responses can be detrimental to your score*.\n",

    "An often encountered step to data pre-processing usually involves querying data that exists within a relational database system. Typically such data may be transactional in nature, and as a result, it is optimized for a relational data model. While this format is critical for performance, efficient storage, and quick updates, it is often not suitable for data science work. In this next question, you will be asked to access data from a fictitious relational database and perform query operations to get it into a suitable format for analysis. The required output for this question is the correct SQL code and query results, you may use any dialect of SQL you wish, but submissions in any other language will be considered incorrect.\n",
