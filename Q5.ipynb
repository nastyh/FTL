    "The internet startup ShinyFancyObjects is looking to make its IPO in the next couple months.  Before doing so, its founders are presenting their company to potential investors and analysts with the goal of generating a higher company valuation before going public.  As a Data Scientist at one of these investment firms, you have been asked to help evaluate ShinyFancyObjects and determine if it would be a good investment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You have been provided two resources to help with your analysis; a company fact sheet provided by ShinyFancyObjects, and a table containing data about their customer history.  Using these two pieces of information, determine if this company would be a good long-term investment, and explain why or why not.\n",

    "This table shows new customers acquired by month, along with how many of those same customers remained active in the following months.  As an example, in January 2016, 1,098 new customers were acquired.  One month later, out of the initial 1,098, only 875 were still active, two months later, 800 were active, and so on.  Whereas in February of 2016, 1,358 new customers were acquired, of which 500 were still active six months after. \n",

    "Obviously, the provided information is not enough for making any investment decision. Decisions are made after building a financial model, not after looking a customer history table.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it’s not clear whether the company has generated any revenues and operating losses (probably, the latter has happened, though). As a result standard techniques of estimating cash flows, growth and discount rates are deemed worthless. New rounds of fundraising also dilute the capital structure of the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, for the sake of keeping this write-up short, we won’t focus on assessing formal valuation methods, such as a DCF, or a comparables method.\n",
    "Explicit valuation, however, should consider dilution, investors’ ownership, the amount of capital invested in various rounds.\n",
    "Implicit valuation considers the existence of warrants (read, options), liquidation preferences, and dividends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schematically, we can provide something like that:\n",
    "- Find proper comps and use their EV/sales\n",
    "- Apply to the company’s sales\n",
    "- Discount to the present value using some target return\n",
    "- Add money you will bring over time to estimate the post-money valuation\n",
    "- Account for a proportional increase in the share of equity: added money / post-money value\n",
    "- Come up with an IPO price\n",
    "- Adjust the price for early investors, institutional investors, deal-runners that are interested in partaking, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The provided table can be used for a bottom-up approach to estimate future cashflows. Users can serve as a proxy of revenues, assuming no product launches are planned immediately. However, it’s not helpful for estimating operating costs. \n",
    "As of right now, analyzing the provided table is a futile exercise. The churn rate seems to follow a usual pattern with a November’16 spike that positively affects later cohorts of users. However, it’s hard to say how extended this spike will be. From the limited amount of data in the respective rows, users churn out a similar pace.\n",
    "\n",
    "To the bonus question, the following documents might be helpful in order to conduct an assessment:\n",
    "- Existing agreements regarding the past rounds\n",
    "- Original business plan outlining projected sources of revenue and operating expenses\n",
    "- Income statements and balance sheets to understand whether the company follows the plan\n",
    "- Qualitative information: founder vesting, board seats, anti-dilution provisions, protective provisions, information rights, registration rights, redemption schedule  \n"
